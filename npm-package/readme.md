## Data Source
The data is parsed from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-test.txt into a JSON list of dictionaries from which the emoji are retrieved. The list, created with the `helper/dumper.py` script, is updated with the very version of Unicode emoji.
Each dictionary presents several information reguarding an emoji, and can be retrieved using the verbose `v=true` parameter. An example is reported.
The file [emoji.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacksalici/emoji-helper/main/helper/emoji.json) can be also used for new API.

```json
 {
        "emoji": "ðŸŒµ",
        "description": "cactus",
        "group": "Animals & Nature",
        "subgroup": "plant-other",
        "code": "1F335",
        "status": "fully-qualified",
        "version": "E0.6"
    }
```
### Emoji Groups and Subgroups
Usable in the query parameters. Multi word terms must be formatted in kebab-case, "&" must be replaced with "and".
