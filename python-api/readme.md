# Emoji List API üèú
Simple yet powerful RESTful API for querying emoji.

```python
import requests
import json

data=requests.get('https://emoji.deta.dev/random?n=10&skintones=False&nogroup=Symbols,Flags')
print(json.loads(data.text))
 
# ["‚òî","ü§µ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","ü§ç","üóø","üé•","üë¥","üèÉ","ü•Ñ","üßÉ","‚úåÔ∏è"]
```
## Query syntax

### Endpoint:
`GET`
### Routes:
| Routes | Description |
|--|--|
|`/`| Get list of emoji|
| `/random` | Get random lists of emoji|
| `/groups` | Get the groups hierarchy of the emoji.|

### Parameters:
Valid for both `/` and `/random` routes.

|Parameter: type |Description | Default value |
|-|-|-|
|`n: int`| Number of emoji to retrieve | `1` for `/random` route, `0` (means all) for `/` route
|`allstatus: bool`| By default only emoji with status "fully-qualified" are retrieved. | `False`
|`noduplicates: bool`| In the retrieved list no duplicates are allowed by default. This means that the n value must be considered as a massimum value. | `True`
|`group: str`| Groups of emoji allowed*| `""` (all groups are allowed)
|`subgroup: str` | Subgroups of emoji allowed* | `""` (all subgroups are allowed)
|`nogroup: str` | Groups of emoji not allowed* | `""` (all groups are allowed)
|`nosubgroup: str` |  Subgroups of emoji not allowed* | `""` (all subgroups are allowed)
|`skintones: bool` | Skintones where present. | `False` for `/` route, `True` for `/random` route
|`v: bool` | If the request is verbose, a dictionary is retrieved. | `False`
|`search: str` | Filter by search terms. | `""` (no filter is applied)
|`maxversion: float` | Max version of the emoji | `14.0`


*concatenate more terms with `,`. The terms must be written in kebab-case, "&" become "and". See below for the list of groups and subgroups

## Data Source
The data is parsed from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-test.txt into a JSON list of dictionaries from which the emoji are retrieved. The list, created with the `helper/dumper.py` script, is updated with the very version of Unicode emoji.
Each dictionary presents several information reguarding an emoji, and can be retrieved using the verbose `?v=True` parameter. An example is reported.
The file [emoji.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacksalici/emoji-list-api/main/src/emoji.json) can be also used for new API.

```json
 {
        "emoji": "üåµ",
        "description": "cactus",
        "group": "Animals & Nature",
        "subgroup": "plant-other",
        "code": "1F335",
        "status": "fully-qualified",
        "version": "E0.6"
    }
```
### Emoji Groups and Subgroups
Usable in the query parameters. Multi word terms must be formatted in kebab-case, "&" must be replaced with "and".
